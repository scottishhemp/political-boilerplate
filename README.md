=====================

This a collection of what I believe to be sensible manifesto items to be developed diverged from and expanded upon.


"The After Party are the only political party who are actively campaigning for more off duty police officers at parties."

The After Party Manifesto

Economics

Everyone should arrive at the afterpary with everything they need.

If someone does not arrive at the afterparty with everything they need they should be provided with enough.

Materials are locally or internationally sourced depending on the efficency and environmental sustainability of the supply route.

All people will be expected to transport materials to and from the afterparty. 

Some of these people known as Trafikteers will often be expected to carry far more to the afterparty than they possibly need.

The material will be exchanged and bartered until such time as the net cost of it's procurement has been covered at which point the Trafikteer will either move on to the next area of resourch scarcity, or proceed to invest the surplus material back into the vibe. 

Social Responsibility

All afterparty sites are to be continually maintainted to a safe standard by the inhabitants of the site.

When a site has to be abondoned or left fallow a few members will be expected to remain behind and ensure it is left in better condition than before the afterparty arrived.

People who are having tempory allergic reactions to the effects of evolution are expected to be cared for by the community.

People suffering from more serious effects may have to be cared for by trained medical staff.

Infrastructure

All members of the afterparty will be expected to assist in the maintainance, modernisation and prettification of afterparty sites.

Minimal Living Allowance will be paid to all people who commit tens hours per week to the above pursuit.

Jobs

All non essential jobs are to be phased out. All essential jobs are to be automated wherever possible. 

All remaining jobs will be split into three catagories. Anybody Can Do It, You Need To Be Trained, Not Suitable for Everyone.

People will be free to work towards raising their Luxury Goods Allowance by filling whatever combination of the above roles as they see fit.

Education

Education will be free, community directed, immersive and self directed.

People will be expected to actively pursue some form of self directed education to qualify for Luxury Good Allowance work. 

Crime

We don't really expect there to be much crime at the Afterparty.

Anyone witnessing someone acting in a violence or unstable manner will be expected to intervene or ask for help in intervention.
